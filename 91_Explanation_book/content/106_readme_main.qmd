# Readme as entry door {#sec-readme}

Think about your audience when writing OSH documentation, and tailor the
documentation (and design) to them. You may have different entry points
for educatiors, DIY makes, peer scientists, professional engineers and
so on. You can start your documentation with a description of some
pathways and links tailored to specific users.\
\
The readme usually starts with some main information about the hardware
(name, development stage, subject area, license). It may be good to have
that information both in the readme and in a computer readable format,
like a OKH metadata file.

Indeed, your project might be reused by people with different skills,
roles, objectives, and socio-economic and cultural environments. Because
of this it can be useful to create a list of skills that are required to
build (manufacture @sec-product-build-manufacturing-all, and assemble
@sec-product-build-assembly-skills-and-tools) or use the hardware
(@sec-user-skills). Someone trying to build it from scratch, for
example, will require specific set of prior knowledge, skills, and
tools. A different set is needed to perform maintenance tasks. An end
user operating the assembled project might require an entirely distinct
skillset (and documentation).
